# Input-Overlay

This is a simple input overlay that I've made in the Godot engine that has arms that press the buttons. 
I might update later with more themes and/or widgets and/or whatever.

This should work with any xbox or playstation controller although I have only been able to test ps4/5. 
(It does also work when I've used DS4Windows)
Currently there are only 2 themes, both of which show a ps5 controller and buttons.


## How to Use:

1. Download both the .console.exe and the .console.pck to the same directory (folder)
2. Run the .exe
